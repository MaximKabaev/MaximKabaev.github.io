                        There are many ways to find the solution for your mathematical problems. Cheap and slow solution is to use your head,
                        but why would someone do that? Sure, you can use the build-in calculator in your OS, it is probably a better way. The only downside of that is
                        it won't give you the absolute original and new looking design as this calculator would. Download and try yourself :)
